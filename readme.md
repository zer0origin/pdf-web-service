# üìÑ pdf-web-service
**pdf-web-service** is a lightweight web server that hosts the user interface for interacting with internal PDF services. It is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) and provides a responsive and modern user experience using **Go templates** and **HTMX**.

## Features

- Built with the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework
- Renders a dynamic SPA using Go's `html/template` and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- Real-time toast notifications pushed to all connected users and sessions
- Connects seamlessly to internal services:
  - `pdf-api-service` ‚Äì Handles PDF generation and manipulation
  - `pdf-data-service` ‚Äì Manages PDF-related data storage and retrieval

## Architecture

The `pdf-web-service` acts as the frontend layer of the PDF platform. It delegates processing and data operations to internal services, ensuring a clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data management.

## Tech Stack

- **Go** ‚Äì Backend language
- **Gin** ‚Äì Web framework for routing and middleware
- **HTMX** ‚Äì Enables partial updates for a dynamic user experience
- **Go Templates** ‚Äì Server-rendered HTML templates

## Toast Notification Endpoint

The server provides a dedicated endpoint that enables toast-style notifications across **all active sessions and users**. This allows for system-wide alerts, updates, and feedback messages without requiring full page reloads.

## Development

```bash
go run main.go
````

The service will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This service depends on internal services (`pdf-api-service`, `pdf-data-service`) and may require them to be running for full functionality.
